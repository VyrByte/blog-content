# How to Use SFTP Clients on Teramont.net: WinSCP, FileZilla, and CyberDuck

:::info
This tutorial is designed for Teramont.net users who want to connect their files via SFTP using the Teramont Control Panel (TCP). We will focus exclusively on SFTP, since the panel automatically handles the required configuration. Make sure you have your credentials ready before starting.

## Introduction to SFTP on Teramont.net

SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a secure protocol for transferring files between your computer and the Teramont.net server. Unlike FTP, SFTP encrypts the connection, protecting your data. On Teramont.net, SFTP access is easily configured through the Teramont Control Panel (TCP).

To obtain your SFTP credentials:
1. Log into your TCP panel at [https://panel.teramont.net](https://panel.teramont.net).
2. Go to the **Settings** section of the server you want to connect to.
3. Under **SFTP Details**, you will find:
    - **Server Address**: For example, `sftp://mia05.teramont.net:2022` (the subdomain may vary depending on your server).
    - **Username**: A unique identifier, such as `ujmtg9pne3715212`.
    - **Password**: Use the same password you use to access the TCP panel.

Take note! The "Launch SFTP" button in the TCP panel will take you directly to the SFTP setup and quickly launch WinSCP.

:::warning
Do not share your SFTP credentials with anyone, as they grant full access to your files. Instead, you can create Sub-Users.
:::

> [!TIP]  
> Always update your SFTP clients to the latest version for better security.

Next, we will guide you step by step to connect using three popular clients: WinSCP (for Windows), FileZilla (cross-platform), and CyberDuck (for macOS and Windows).

## Connecting with WinSCP

WinSCP is a free and open-source SFTP client, ideal for Windows users. Download it from [https://winscp.net](https://winscp.net).

### Steps to connect:
1. Install and open WinSCP. The "Login" dialog will appear.
2. In "Protocol," select **SFTP**.
3. In "Host name," enter the server host without the prefix (e.g., `mia05.teramont.net`).
4. In "Port," enter **2022** (or the port indicated in your panel).
5. In "User name," enter your username (e.g., `ujmtg9pne3715212`).
6. In "Password," enter your TCP panel password.
7. Optional: Click "Save" to store the session with a name such as "My Extreme 6GB Server."
8. Click "Login" to connect.

If you receive a connection error, check that the port is correct (2022 instead of the default 22) and that no local firewalls are blocking the connection.
:::

Once connected, you will see remote files on the right panel and local files on the left. Drag and drop to transfer files.

> [!WARNING]  
> Avoid transferring sensitive files without additional encryption if needed.

## Connecting with FileZilla

FileZilla is a free and cross-platform SFTP client. Download it from [https://filezilla-project.org](https://filezilla-project.org).

    - **Password**: Enter your TCP panel password.
    - **Port**: Enter **2022**.
3. Click "Quickconnect."

### Alternative: Using Site Manager for saved connections:
1. Go to "File" > "Site Manager."
2. Create a new entry:
    - **Protocol**: Select SFTP.
    - **Host**: `mia05.teramont.net`.
    - **Port**: **2022**.
    - **Logon Type**: Normal.
    - **User**: Your username.
    - **Password**: Your password.
3. Click "Connect."

## Final Notes

With these steps, you will be able to securely access and manage your files on Teramont.net using SFTP. If you encounter issues, check your credentials in the TCP panel or contact Teramont support.

If you forget your password, reset it in the TCP panel, as it is the same for SFTP.
